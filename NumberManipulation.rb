# Number Manipulation Examples

puts 10 + 5 # This will output the sum of 10 and 5, which is 15.
puts 10 - 5 # This will output the difference between 10 and 5, which is 5.
puts 10 * 5 # This will output the product of 10 and 5, which is 50.
puts 10 / 5 # This will output the quotient of 10 divided by 5, which is 2.
puts 10 % 3 # This will output the remainder of 10 divided by 3, which is 1.
puts 2**3 # This will output 2 raised to the power of 3, which is 8. 
puts Math.sqrt(16) # This will output the square root of 16, which is 4.0.
puts (10 + 5) * 2 # This will first add 10 and 5, resulting in 15, and then multiply by 2, resulting in 30.
puts 10.5.round # This will round the float 10.5 to the nearest integer, resulting in 11.
puts 10 / 3.0 # This will perform floating-point division, resulting in approximately 3.3333333333333335.

num = 10
num += 100
puts num # This will output the updated value of num, which is now 110.

num = -36.8
puts num.abs # This will output the absolute value of -36.8, which is 36.8.
puts num.ceil # This will output the smallest integer greater than or equal to -36.8, which is -36.
puts num.floor # This will output the largest integer less than or equal to -36.8, which is -37.
puts num.to_i # This will convert the float -36.8 to an integer, resulting in -36.
puts num.round # This will round the float -36.8 to the nearest integer, resulting in -37.

puts Math.log(100) # This will output the natural logarithm of 100, which is approximately 4.605170185988091.
